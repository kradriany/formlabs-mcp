    # Introduction
    The Formlabs Local API is designed for integrations that want to automate
    job preparation, getting local-network printer status, or sending jobs to Formlabs printers
    without launching the PreForm graphical user interface. A server application
    must be installed and run on a user's computer to use this API.

    Example use cases:
    - Scripted job preparation that takes a folder of models, sets up a print,
      and uploads it to a printer without user input.
    - Deep and custom integrations into 3D Modeling and Design software to
      prepare print scenes beyond the scope of the PreForm Command Line Arguments.

    This API uses RESTful principles. This means the API is organized around
    resources and collections of resources. Resources and collections are each
    available at their own URI. You can interact with these resources using
    standard HTTP Methods on the resource's URI.

    Example endpoint:
    ```
    GET http://localhost:44388/scene/
    ```

    Responses from the API server will be in JSON and are documented throughout
    the reference docs. This API is described by an [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0).
    This interactive documentation is automatically generated from the specification file.

    # Technical Overview

    ## PreFormServer Background Application
    All Local API integrations involve starting the PreFormServer background
    application to expose its HTTP API, then making local HTTP API calls in your own code.
    This application is like [PreForm](https://formlabs.com/software/preform/), Formlabs' regular job preparation application,
    but it does not open a graphical window, and interaction is done via HTTP API requests.
    The PreFormServer application is supported on Windows and MacOS with separate
    downloads for each Operating System.

    ### Installing PreFormServer
    The PreFormServer application can be downloaded from the [Formlabs API downloads and release notes page](https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Formlabs-API-downloads-and-release-notes).
    After downloading, unzip the file and move the application to the desired location on your computer.
    Any location can be used as the path to the application should be referenced from your integration code.

    In the current release, we also recommend adding the PreFormServer application the users' antivirus software exception list or explicitly whitelisting the application in the security settings of MacOS.

    On MacOS, you can use the following terminal command to whitelist the PreFormServer application:
    ```
    xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine PreFormServer.app
    ```

    ### Starting PreFormServer
    The PreFormServer application can started manually from your Operating System's command prompt or terminal,
    but most integrations will start the application programatically from integration code.
    By default the HTTP Server will listen on port 44388, but this can be changed by passing in
    a different port number as the command line argument `--port` to the PreFormServer application.

    The HTTP API server started by the PreFormServer application cannot immediately respond to requests.
    When the server is ready to accept requests, it will output `READY FOR INPUT` in the standard output.

    For example, running the PreFormServer application on Windows from the command prompt:
    ```
    PreFormServer.exe
    ```
    will output something like the following:
    ```
    starting HTTP server
    Listening...
    HTTP server listening on port  44388
    READY FOR INPUT
    ```

    ## Making API Requests
    The code to make HTTP API requests to a running PreFormServer can be written
    directly in your integration code or by using a generated library that does
    the API calls. The endpoints and format of the HTTP API are described on this
    page and in the openapi.yaml file.  Formlabs provides an example [Python library](https://github.com/Formlabs/formlabs-api-python)
    that handles the setup and request formatting.

    ## Glossary
    - **Scene**: The current state of a job that can be printed on a particular printer model.
      This includes both the “Scene Settings” and all of the currently loaded models and their support structures.
    - **Scene Settings**: Printer type and material information of scene. Describes the
      build platform size, the printer capabilities, and what material and print settings
      it is set up to be printed with.

    ## Stateful Interactions
    The PreForm Server is stateful in that while it is running, it keeps a cache of the
    current scene and requests will use the cached scene and possibly modify it.
    For example, initially a scene may be empty and then if a load model request is made
    then the cached scene will have one model loaded. Calling the load model requests
    again will load another copy of the model resulting in two models in the cached scene.

    ## Blocking Calls & Asynchronous Requests
    Unless otherwise stated, API calls are blocking: the HTTP request will not return
    until the operation has completed.  Some requests like running the auto support
    action on a scene with many complicated models could take over 1 minute (depending
    on computer resources). The Server has a timeout of 10 minutes for all requests.

    Requests made asynchronously will use the last cached state. For example, if a “get scene”
    request is made during a “auto support” request that has not finished, then the
    “get scene” request will return data that will not include the auto support changes.

    ## File Paths
    When saving and loading files, the local API inputs expect full operating system paths
    to local files on disk.

    Correct file path:
    - `C:\Projects\Models\part.stl`

    Incorrect file paths:
    - `.\Models\part.stl`
    - `%ENV_VAR%\part.stl`
    - `part.stl`
    - `https://filestorage.com/part.stl`

    # Errors
    Conventional HTTP response codes are used to indicate the success or failure of
    an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in
    the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided.
    Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Formlabs' servers.

    # Security
    The HTTP Server that PreForm uses to communicate is only exposed to the local
    network of your computer and not to the public Internet, unless you have
    configured your computer to expose the port running the PreForm Server to the Internet.

    Some requests require an Internet connection, require Dashboard login, and
    make web requests to perform their action (such as printing to a remote printer).

        The returned JSON has 3 layers: Printer types (e.g. "Form 4"), Materials (e.g. "Black V5"),
        and Material Setting (e.g. "0.025mm" or "0.100mm (Legacy)"). These "label" strings at each level
        are the preferred way of referring to that printer types, materials, and settings. They can
        presented in a UI as a 3-level dropdown menu, or a flat filtered list. This list is static
        (it will not change for a given version of the PreFormServer executable).

        Each value has `scene_settings` with all data needed to create a new scene. It can be passed
        directly to a /scene/ POST to create a scene for that printer, material, and materialSettings.
